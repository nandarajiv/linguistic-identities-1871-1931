## Project Examining the Progressive Decline of Minority Linguistic Identities in India between 1870 and 1931 using the Decadal British Census Records

An old Hindi proverb wittily observes the linguistic diversity in India – _‘Kos kos par badle paani, char kos par vaani’_ - for every _kos_ (approximately 3km) the water changes, and every four _koses_, the language does.<br/>
Colonial census-takers attempted to enumerate the population of India through the census. However, in the processes of laying down frameworks for which languages to record and which to add to a miscellaneous category, all while other factors such as new agricultural policies, larger settlements, increased connectivity and greater Western influence come into play, there is a progressive decline of distinct linguistic identities, which are often the sole language in compact, highly localised areas. 
<br/>This phenomenon can be observed in various regions in the subcontinent, and the decadal census of colonial India gives insight into this transformation.
